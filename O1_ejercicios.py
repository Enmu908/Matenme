# O(1) Exercise Scenarios

## Exercise 1: Get the first element of a list
- **Best Case:** O(1) - Direct access to the first element.
- **Average Case:** O(1) - Direct access to the first element regardless of list size.
- **Worst Case:** O(1) - Direct access remains O(1) even as the list grows.

## Exercise 2: Set a value in a fixed-size array
- **Best Case:** O(1) - Accessing a specific index.
- **Average Case:** O(1) - Access remains direct, irrespective of array size.
- **Worst Case:** O(1) - Direct index access doesn't change with larger arrays.

## Exercise 3: Returning a constant value
- **Best Case:** O(1) - Returning a predetermined value directly.
- **Average Case:** O(1) - There is no dependency on input size.
- **Worst Case:** O(1) - Still returns a constant regardless of any surrounding operations.
